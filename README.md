# Next.js Baseapp for product-ready project

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

This is an opinionated baseapp for product-ready project to be used as a starting point for your project. To start, run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
pnpm install
```

To start the development server with storybook, run the following command in your terminal. This is helpful for developing components in isolation.

```bash
pnpm dev-storybook
```

To start the development server, run the following command in your terminal.

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. If you are new to Next.js, you can go through the home page to learn more about the baseapp.

## ðŸ“– Documentation

### Standard naming convention

1. All files and folders name should be in **kebab-case**. Eg: `toggle-button.tsx` or `leave-management/`.
2. All variables and functions should be in **camelCase**. eg: `const isButtonDisabled = true;` or `function toggleButton() {}`.
3. All React components should be in **PascalCase**, so it can be called as a React component. Eg: `<Button/>`.
4. All Interfaces should be in **PascalCase**, and it should have a prefix of `I` or suffix of `Props`, such as `interface IButton {}` or `interface ButtonProps {}`. Eg:

    ```ts
    interface IButtonProps {
        isDisabled: boolean;
    }
    ```

5. All Types should be in **PascalCase**, and it should have a prefix of `T`. Eg:

   ```ts
   type TUser = {
      name: string;
   }
   ```

6. All Enums AND its contents should be in **PascalCase**, and it should have a prefix of `E`. Eg:

    ```ts
    EButtonColor {
        Primary,
        Secondary,
        Tertiary
    }
    ```

7. All Classes name should be in **PascalCase**.

### Next.js files and folder structure cheat sheet

1. The website structure will follow the `app` folder. Each folder that have `page.tsx` will be considered a website directory.
`app/page.tsx` will be `https://example.com/`.
`app/articles/page.tsx` will be `https://example.com/articles`.
`app/articles/[id]/page.tsx` will be `https://example.com/articles/1`.
2. You can group multiple directory with `()` and the folder with `()` is hidden from the URL. For example, `app/(modules)/articles/page.tsx` will be `https://example.com/articles`.
3. You can exclude a folder from the URL by prefixing it with `_`. For example, `app/_components/anything.tsx`.
4. You can create a dynamic route by prefixing the folder with `[]`. For example, `app/[id]/page.tsx` will be `https://example.com/1`.
5. See example on this project to know how to pass arguments from the URL.

### How to structure the files and folders

Your project should be structured as follows:

```bash
â”œâ”€â”€ app
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ (modules)
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ leave-management (example)
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ _types
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ t-leave.tsx
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ _components
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ client-components
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ create-button.tsx
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ update-button.tsx
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ server-components
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ delete-button.tsx
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ _data
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ leave-client.tsx
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ utils.tsx
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ [id]
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ edit
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ create
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ toggle-button (example)
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ toggle-button.tsx
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ toggle-button.stories.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ public
|   â”œâ”€â”€ general
|   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ default-avatar.png
|   â”œâ”€â”€ modules
|   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ leave-management (example)
|   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ example-image.png
â”œâ”€â”€ styles
â”œâ”€â”€ utils
```

#### Root level

1. The main app directory is in the `@/app/` folder.
2. For shared components, they should be in the `@/components` folder.
3. Each shared component file should have their own folder. For example, the `Button` component should be in the `@/components/button` folder.
4. Each shared component should have their own storybook file. For example, the `button` component should have a `button.stories.tsx` file. This way, all developers can explore the component in isolation.
5. All static files should be in the `@/public` folder.
6. All global styles should be in the `@/styles` folder.
7. All shared utils should be in the `@/utils` folder.

#### Feature level

1. Each main features should be in its own folder in the `@/app/(modules)`. For example, the `articles` feature should be in the `articles` folder. Or the `leave-management` feature should be in the `leave-management` folder.
2. For customized components on a per feature basis, they should be in the feature directory, which is `_components`. For example, the `articles` feature should have its own `@/app/articles/_components` folder.

### When to use server side rendering VS client side rendering

1. For most pages, please use SSR so the first-paint will be faster. Then all dynamic contents inside the page can be rendered on client side. Why? We can use our state management to optimize the UX.
